# Introduction/Business Problem

The City of New York is famous for its excelllent cuisine. It's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. 
Sushi restaurants have become so popular in the United States now it seems that there is  one on every corner, not only in major cities but also in smaller cities. Starting a sushi restaurant can be a great business opportunity, but you need to distinguish yourself from others to enjoy long-term success.

My client wants to open his business in Manhattan area, so I focus on that borough during my analysis. We define potential neighborhood based on the number of sushi bars which are operating right in each neighborhood. Manhattan has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition. New sushi bar should be open in an area that inadequate neighborhood in this way the bar can attract more customers. Therefore, this analysis necessary to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to other sushi places.

# Data Selection
